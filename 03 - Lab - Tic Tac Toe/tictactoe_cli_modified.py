'''Tic-Tac-Toe

Created for COS30002 AI for Games, Lab,
by Clinton Woodward <cwoodward@swin.edu.au>

For class use only. Do not publically share or post this code without
permission.

Notes:
* Formatted with 4-space indentation
* This simple function based implementation does not use an OO design.
* Each function has a description string -- read to know more.
* Overall game flow follows a standard game loop trinity:
    - process_input() # from the current player (human/AI)
    - update_mode()   # check the players input, then update the game world
    - render_board()  # draw the current game board
* Global variable (oh no!) are used to store and share game related data.
* You need to be able to interact with this code when it runs. Either run
  from a terminal or make sure your tool allows you to enter input as the
  script runs.

If you want to create your own AI it is suggested that you:
* Copy the get_ai_move function and rename it.
* Write your own new fancy AI thinking code
* Update the "process_input" function to call your new "get_ai_move" code.

Want OO? There's another version of this code. Same functions, with nice
classes.

Updates:
2019-03-12: python 2 to 3 (mainly print() changes, and raw_input to input())
